The document is an introduction to the COMP9120 Database Management Systems unit of study at the University of Sydney. The unit is designed to cover how database management systems work, including design, query, efficient access and storage of databases, and theoretical aspects underpinning relational databases. The unit will not be an SQL programming course, but will use SQL extensively. The students will learn about the design of relational databases, including data modeling, query languages, and database management systems. The unit will also cover database integrity, application development, and security. Assessments will include two group assignments, a quiz, weekly in-lab checkpoints, and a final exam. Students will learn about the different roles in database management systems, including system analysts, database designers, application programmers, and administrators. The unit will cover various topics, including data independence, declarative querying, transaction management, and concurrency control. The students will also learn about the importance of data security and protection. The unit will use various software, including PostgreSQL and Java/Python, and students are expected to learn the basics of programming in these languages to complete the assignments. The unit aims to provide students with the knowledge and skills to design, implement, and manage relational databases.
